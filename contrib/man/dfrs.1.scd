# NAME

dfrs - Display file system space usage using graphs and colors

# SYNOPSIS

*dfrs* [_OPTION_]...  [_FILE_]...

# DESCRIPTION

*dfrs* displays the amount of disk space available on the file system containing each file name argument. If no file name is given, the space available on all currently mounted file systems is shown.

*dfrs*(1) is a tool similar to *df*(1) except that it is able to show a graph along with the data and is able to use colors.

Without any argument, size is displayed in human-readable format.

*-a*, *--more*
	Show more file systems; use *-a* twice to show all

*-aa*, *--all*
	Show all file systems

*-c*
	Force colors even if stdout is not a tty. This is useful with *watch -c*

*--color* [_WHEN_]
	Colorize the output; WHEN can be 'auto' (default if omitted), 'always', or 'never'

	Show inode instead of block usage
